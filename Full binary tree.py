#binary tree theorem

# Let, i = the number of internal nodes
#        n = be the total number of nodes
#        l = number of leaves
#       λ = number of levels
# The number of leaves is i + 1.
# The total number of nodes is 2i + 1.
# The number of internal nodes is (n – 1) / 2.
# The number of leaves is (n + 1) / 2.
# The total number of nodes is 2l – 1.
# The number of internal nodes is l – 1.
# The number of leaves is at most 2λ - 1.
